It's a website about my Portfolio.There also have links in the navigation that is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport,like the page size becomes small the nav will become disapper.

It has four parts:
